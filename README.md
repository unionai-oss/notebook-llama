# ðŸ“–ðŸ¦™ NotebookLlama on Union

This repo contains an open source implementation of NotebookLM that runs on Union. This repo
adapts the [NotebookLlama](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/end-to-end-use-cases/NotebookLlama) example in Meta's
[`llama-cookbook`](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook) repo.

## Setup

### Account creation and API key setup

To run this workshop, first you need a [Github account](http://www.github.com/).

Next, create a [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) account. On the HuggingFace website,
create a HuggingFace API key [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

![Create HuggingFace API key](static/huggingface_api_key.png)

If you don't already, request access to the [Llama 3.2 3B model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) 
and [Llama 3.2 1B model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct).

Then, create Union Serverless account [here](https://signup.union.ai/).

Once you've signed up, going to the [Union dashboard](https://serverless.union.ai/)
should look something like this:

![Union Dashboard](static/union_dashboard.png)

On the bottom right, you should see that you have `$ 30` in credits, which is
sufficient for running this workshop.

## Start a workspace

Start the `default` workspace through the Union dashboard.

![Start Workspace](static/workspace.png)

Once started, you can click on `Open in VSCode` to open the workspace in your browser.

## Create your environment

Create a virtual environment

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the `union` SDK.

### Create secrets on Union

Create Union API key called `notebook-llama` for app serving

```bash
$ union create api-key admin --name notebook-llama
```

You can list the api keys you have with:

```bash
$ union get api-key admin
```

Then create Union secret for the HuggingFace API key we created in the step above:

```bash
$ union create secret huggingface_api_key
```

You should see a `Enter secret value:` prompt to paste on the secret value.
his will create a secret in Union with the name `huggingface_api_key`.

Now do the same with the `notebook-llama` app serving Union API key:

```bash
$ union create secret union_api_key
```

## Quickstart

Run the workflow with a PDF file from a URL:

```bash
$ union run --remote notebook_llama/pdf_to_podcast.py pdf_to_podcast --pdf_path https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/544593v2.full.pdf
```

Run the workflow with a local PDF file:

```bash
$ union run --remote notebook_llama/pdf_to_podcast.py pdf_to_podcast --pdf_path data/544593v2.full.pdf
```

Deploy the streamlit app:

```bash
$ union deploy apps app.py notebook-llama-app
```
